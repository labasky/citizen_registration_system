- Hobby PostgreSQL database ($9/month)
- Papertrail Logs (Free tier)

**Total Estimated Cost:** $35-$45 for 30 days

**Deployment Steps:**
1. Create a Heroku account
2. Create a new Heroku application
3. Add PostgreSQL add-on
4. Configure environment variables
5. Deploy application code using Git
6. Set up custom domain (if available)
7. Configure SSL certificates

## 12. Conclusion

The choice of deployment option depends on several factors:

- **Budget**: From $35/month (Heroku) to $500+/month (enterprise cloud)
- **Scale**: Expected number of users and data volume
- **Technical Expertise**: Available IT resources and knowledge
- **Security Requirements**: Compliance and data protection needs
- **Long-term Plans**: Trial vs. permanent deployment

For a 30-day deployment, we recommend starting with either DigitalOcean or Heroku for the best balance of cost, simplicity, and functionality. These options can be scaled up or migrated to more robust solutions if the system is adopted for permanent use.

For permanent deployment in a government context, we recommend AWS or Azure due to their comprehensive security features, compliance certifications, and scalability options.
